        <p class="lead">
            Music has been part of my life since I was three years old. I started on piano, added violin at
            age nine, and eventually found my way back to both with a deeper passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was young I loved playing songs I enjoyed, but I was not always motivated to practice.
            By the time I was fourteen I was too busy and stopped lessons for piano and violin.
        </p>
        <p>
            During COVID I fell in love with music again. I started making covers and uploading them to
            YouTube, then brought my violin on my mission to the Ivory Coast so I could keep playing there.
            After coming home I picked up guitar, bought an electric and an acoustic, and began writing my
            own songs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before my mission I taught violin and piano for a year and a half, which helped me learn how to
            explain technique and make practice feel doable. Now I record regularly, often in the music
            building, experimenting with covers, personal songs, and new sounds. It is a space where I can
            explore, create, and keep learning.

    <h2>What I Focus On</h2>
    <p>
        I love helping people learn piano, violin, guitar, and the basics of recording. We can cover
        technique, practice strategies, songwriting, and simple production workflows.
